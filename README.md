**An email app for [ownCloud](https://owncloud.org) (minimum version 7.0.4 & PHP 5.4). At the moment it is a basic IMAP client and in heavy development.** (A possibility for the future would be to also have it be a dedicated email server. But that would always be optional, require additional dependencies and is out of scope for now.)

## Why is this so awesome?

* :rocket: **Integration with other ownCloud apps!** Currently Contacts & Files – more to come.
* :+1: **You can use multiple mail accounts!** Personal and company account? No problem.
* :lock: **Send & receive encrypted emails!** Using the great [Mailvelope](https://mailvelope.com) browser extension.
* :see_no_evil: **We’re not reinventing the wheel!** Based on the great [Horde](http://horde.org) libraries.

And in the works for [version 0.2](https://github.com/owncloud/mail/milestones/0.2):
* :books: [Proper grouping of message threads](https://github.com/owncloud/mail/issues/21)

## Troubleshooting

### Gmail

If you can not access your Gmail account use https://accounts.google.com/DisplayUnlockCaptcha to unlock your account.

### Outlook.com

If you can not access your Outlook.com account try to enable the 'Two-Factor Verification' (https://account.live.com/proofs/Manage) and setup an app password (https://account.live.com/proofs/AppPassword), which you then use for the ownCloud Mail app.

### Dovecot IMAP

If your Dovecot IMAP server prefixes all folders with `INBOX`, ownCloud Mail does not work correcty. 

Check `/etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf`:

```
namespace inbox {
        separator = .
        # All folders prefixed
        # prefix = INBOX.
        prefix =
        inbox = yes
        type = private
}
```


## Developer setup info

Just clone this repo into your apps directory ([ownCloud core installation needed](https://doc.owncloud.org/server/8.1/developer_manual/general/devenv.html)). Additionally you need Composer to install PHP dependencies and npm to get the Javascript dependencies – run this from inside the mail folder:
```bash
sudo install node nodejs-legacy
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
php composer.phar install
```
Debian/Ubuntu people, just execute `install_ubuntu.sh`

### Nightly builds

Instead of setting everything up manually, you can just [download the nighly builds](https://en0ch.se/index.php/s/3v5J3XXeQCCp73p) instead. These builds are updated every 12 hours - 00:00 UTC+0200 (12:00 AM) and 12:00 UTC+0200 (12:00 PM), and are pre-configured with all the needed dependencies.

1. Download
2. Exctract the zip archive to 'path-to-owncloud/apps'
3. Navigate to »Apps«, choose the category »Productivity«, find the Mail app and enable it.

The nighly builds are provided by [Daniel Hansson](https://github.com/enoch85)

### Resetting the app
Connect to your database and run the following commands (`oc_` is the default table prefix):
```sql
DELETE FROM oc_appconfig WHERE appid = 'mail';
DROP TABLE oc_mail_accounts;
```

Go to ownCloud Mail in the browser and run this from the developer console to clear the cache:
```
localStorage.clear();
```


## Configuration

Certain advanced or experimental features need to be specifically enabled in your `config.php`:

### Debug mode
You can enable IMAP backend logging. A horde.log will appear in the same directory as your owncloud.log.
```php
'app.mail.imaplog.enabled' => true
```

### Server-side caching
Mailbox messages and accounts can be cached on the ownCloud server to reduce mail server load:
This requires a valid memcache to be configured
```php
'app.mail.server-side-cache.enabled' => true
```

### Use php-mail for mail sending
You can use the php mail function to send mails. This is needed for some webhosters (1&1 (1und1)):
```php
'app.mail.transport' => 'php-mail'
```
