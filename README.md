**An email app for [ownCloud](https://owncloud.org) (minimum version 7.0.4 & PHP 5.4). It is a basic IMAP client and in heavy development.**

## Why is this so awesome?

* :rocket: **Integration with other ownCloud apps!** Currently Contacts & Files – more to come.
* :inbox_tray: **Multiple mail accounts!** Personal and company account? No problem, and a nice unified inbox.
* :lock: **Send & receive encrypted emails!** Using the great [Mailvelope](https://mailvelope.com) browser extension.
* :see_no_evil: **We’re not reinventing the wheel!** Based on the great [Horde](http://horde.org) libraries.

And in the works for the [coming versions](https://github.com/owncloud/mail/milestones/):
* :books: [Proper grouping of message threads](https://github.com/owncloud/mail/issues/21) 
* :zap: [Caching to make everything faster](https://github.com/owncloud/mail/issues/480)
* :paperclip: [Even better attachment support](https://github.com/owncloud/mail/issues/462) 
* :date: [Calendar integration](https://github.com/owncloud/mail/issues/79) 
* :package: [Folder management & moving mails](https://github.com/owncloud/mail/issues/411) 

## Installation

In your ownCloud, simply navigate to »Apps«, choose the category »Productivity«, find the Mail app and enable it.
Then open the Mail app from the app menu. Put in your email account credentials and off you go!

## Troubleshooting

### Gmail

If you can not access your Gmail account use https://accounts.google.com/DisplayUnlockCaptcha to unlock your account.

### Outlook.com

If you can not access your Outlook.com account try to enable the 'Two-Factor Verification' (https://account.live.com/proofs/Manage) and setup an app password (https://account.live.com/proofs/AppPassword), which you then use for the ownCloud Mail app.

### Dovecot IMAP

If your Dovecot IMAP server prefixes all folders with `INBOX`, ownCloud Mail does not work correcty. 

Check `/etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf`:

```
namespace inbox {
        separator = .
        # All folders prefixed
        # prefix = INBOX.
        prefix =
        inbox = yes
        type = private
}
```


## Developer setup info

Just clone this repo into your apps directory ([ownCloud core installation needed](https://doc.owncloud.org/server/8.1/developer_manual/general/devenv.html)). Additionally you need Composer to install PHP dependencies – run this from inside the mail folder:
```bash
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
php composer.phar install
```
Furthermore, to fetch all JavaScript dependencies using [Npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) run
```bash
npm install
npm run-script bower_deps
```

### Resetting the app
Connect to your database and run the following commands (`oc_` is the default table prefix):
```sql
DELETE FROM oc_appconfig WHERE appid = 'mail';
DROP TABLE oc_mail_accounts;
```

Go to ownCloud Mail in the browser and run this from the developer console to clear the cache:
```
localStorage.clear();
```


## Configuration

Certain advanced or experimental features need to be specifically enabled in your `config.php`:

### Debug mode
You can enable IMAP backend logging. A horde.log will appear in the same directory as your owncloud.log.
```php
'app.mail.imaplog.enabled' => true
```

### Server-side caching
Mailbox messages and accounts can be cached on the ownCloud server to reduce mail server load:
This requires a valid memcache to be configured
```php
'app.mail.server-side-cache.enabled' => true
```

### Use php-mail for mail sending
You can use the php mail function to send mails. This is needed for some webhosters (1&1 (1und1)):
```php
'app.mail.transport' => 'php-mail'
```
