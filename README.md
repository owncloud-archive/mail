An email app for [ownCloud](https://owncloud.org) (minimum version 7). At the moment it is a basic IMAP client and in heavy development.

At the moment we try to use it ourselves and fix [issues related to dogfooding](https://github.com/owncloud/mail/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Adogfood) as well as [integrate with other parts of ownCloud](https://github.com/owncloud/mail/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aintegration).

A possibility for the future would be to also have it be a dedicated email server. But that would always be optional, require additional dependencies and is out of scope for now.
